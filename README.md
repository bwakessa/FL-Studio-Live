# FL-Studio-Live
This project attempts to support real-time collaboration on FL Studio. The FL Studio software only reads file data on startup, so this project attempts to get around that my mimicking real-time updates by automatically reloading the program on the user's side whenever a change is merged. This bypass isn't a very smooth experience for the user, so this project is simply for Proof-of-Concept.

## Functionality
So far, this project only updates piano roll patterns in real-time. Support for the playlist and arrangement are yet to come.
